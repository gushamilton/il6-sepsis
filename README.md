# il6-sepsis

This Github contains the code and underlying data for the IL-6 and sepsis manuscript (currently under review). Any queries please contact fergus.hamilton@bristol.ac.uk.

It contains

1. Underlying data (in data folder)
2. QQ and Manhattan plots for GWAS (in GWAS folder)

I have not included code as using the TwoSampleMR package it is as simple as running mr(dat) on the harmonised data. And then visualising and plotting can be done on these results.
